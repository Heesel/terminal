# Welcome to my portfolio

Hi everyone,

Welcome to my portfolio website. I made a simple terminal in the browser using Nuxt JS and tailwindcss. 
The terminal has commands like:

- help
- colors
- color [color]
- clear
- github
- linkedin
- and more...

It also features a command history that works by using the up and down arrow key. Due to the fact that I am physically, I build the website for 80% using my voice. 

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
